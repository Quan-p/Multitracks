## Comments

I took the liberty of adding in similar styling to the actual Multitracks website such as hover effects and dropdown menus.

Due to time and the scope of the assessment I chose not to add more function to the mock-up such as a functional cart counter, deletion functions, etc.

I would like to note that this was my first time attempting to use media queries to make a super mobile friendy web page.  However, I was pleased with the result and hope it is indicative of my skills and ability to learn on the fly.

Thank you for your consideration.
